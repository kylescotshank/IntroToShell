# Navigating Files and Directories

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories is called the **file system**. It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called "folders"), which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
To start exploring them, let's open a shell window. When you have, you'll likely see a prompt with this:

~~~
$
~~~

The dollar sign is a **prompt**, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources, do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.

Let's try our first bit of interaction. Type the command `whoami`, then press the Enter key (sometimes marked Return) to send the command to the shell.
The command's output is the ID of the current user, i.e., it shows us who the shell thinks we are:

~~~
$ whoami
~~~

On my own machine, the output was as follows:

~~~
kshank
$
~~~

Pretty neat! What happened here? 

When we typed `whoami` the shell performed the following series of commands:

1.  found a program called `whoami`,
2.  ran that program,
3.  displayed that program's output
4.  displayed a new prompt to tell us that it's ready for more commands.

***

Next, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd` (which stands for "print working directory"). At any moment, our **current working directory** is our current default directory, i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in unless we explicitly specify something else. On my machine, the computer's response is `/Users/kshank`, which is my **home directory**:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~

~~~
/Users/kshank
~~~

## Home Directory

The home directory path will look different on different operating systems. On Linux it may look like `/home/kshank`, and on Windows it will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\nkshank` or `C:\Users\kshank`. (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.) In future examples, we've used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.  

To understand what a "home directory" is, let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the sake of example, we'll be illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.  After this illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem, which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.  

On Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:

<p align="center">
<kbd>
  <img src="../Images/directory.png"/>
</kbd>
</p>

At the top is the **root directory** that holds everything else. We refer to it using a slash character `/` on its own.

Inside that directory are several other directories: `bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored), `data` (for miscellaneous data files), `Users` (where users' personal directories are located), `tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term), and so on.  

We know that our current working directory -- in this example, `/Users/nelle` -- is stored inside `/Users` because `/Users` is the first part of its name. Similarly, we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/` because its name begins with `/`.

Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character. When it appears at the front of a file or directory name, it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a name, it's just a separator.

## Listing Files

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`, which stands for "listing":

~~~
$ ls
~~~

The output of which (on my machine) looks like this:

~~~
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
~~~

*Note*: Remember =  your results may be slightly different depending on your operating system and how you have customized your filesystem.

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns. We can make its output more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`, which tells `ls` to add a trailing `/` to the names of directories:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~

~~~
data
papers
personal
~~~

`ls` has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:

~~~
$ ls --help
~~~

The output being:

~~~
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

                               to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files;
                               if STYLE is prefixed with 'posix-', STYLE
                               takes effect only outside the POSIX locale

  -U                         do not sort; list entries in directory order
  -v                         natural sort of (version) numbers within text
  -w, --width=COLS           set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit

      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).
Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).

Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

Exit status:
 0  if OK,
 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

Whew! That's a lot to take in. Many bash commands, and programs that people have written that can be run from within bash, support a `--help` flag to display more information on how to use the commands or programs.

For more information on how to use `ls` we can type `man ls`. `man` is the Unix "manual" command: it prints a description of a command and its options, and (if you're lucky) provides a few examples of how to use it.

To navigate through the `man` pages, you may use the up and down arrow keys to move line-by-line, or try the "b" and spacebar keys to skip up and down by full page. Quit the `man` pages by typing "q".

Here, we can see that our home directory contains mostly **sub-directories**. Any names in your output that don't have trailing slashes, are plain old **files**. And note that there is a space between `ls` and `-F`: without it, the shell thinks we're trying to run a command called `ls-F`, which doesn't exist.

We can also use `ls` to see the contents of a different directory.  Let's take a look at our `Desktop` directory by running `ls -F Desktop`, i.e.,
the command `ls` with the **arguments** `-F` and `Desktop`. The second argument --- the one *without* a leading dash --- tells `ls` that
we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

~~~
$ ls -F Desktop
~~~

~~~
data/
papers/
personal/
~~~

Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories on your Desktop. Take a look at your Desktop to confirm that
your output is accurate.  

As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that your files are organized in an hierarchical file system.  
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work: it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory, just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, but it's a self-defeating strategy.

## Changing Directories

We now know how to look at the contents of a folder, we can learn how to change directories. 

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a directory name to change our working directory. `cd` stands for "change directory", which is a bit misleading: the command doesn't change the directory, it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.

Let's say we want to move to the `data/` directory we saw above.  We can use the following series of commands to get there:

~~~
$ cd Desktop
$ cd data
~~~

These commands will move us from our home directory onto our Desktop, then into the `data` directory. `cd` doesn't print anything, but if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now.

~~~
$ pwd
~~~

~~~
/Users/kshank/Desktop/data
~~~

And now we can take a peek around:

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~

~~~
amino-acids.txt   elements/     pdb/          salmon.txt
animals.txt       morse.txt     planets.txt     sunspot.txt
~~~

Great! You can see that the directory contains several files and sub-directories. Now that we know how to go **down** a directory, how do we go **up**? We might first try the following:

~~~
cd Desktop
~~~

~~~
-bash: cd: data: No such file or directory
~~~

Huh! We get an error.  Why is this?  

With our methods so far, `cd` can only see sub-directories inside your current directory. It thus looked for a directory called `Desktop` inside of `data`, which doesn't exist.  There are different ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start with the simplest.  

There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level that looks like this:

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~

`..` is a special directory name meaning "the directory containing this one", or more succinctly, the **parent** of the current directory. Sure enough, if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/Users/kshank/Desktop/`:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~

~~~
/Users/kshank/Desktop
~~~

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`.  If we want to display it, we can give `ls` the `-a` flag:

~~~
$ ls -F -a
~~~

~~~
./                  .secret/         papers/
../                 data/            personal/
~~~

`-a` stands for "show all"; it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`,
such as `..` (which, if we're in `/Users/kshank`, refers to the `/Users` directory) As you can see, it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`,
which means "the current working directory". It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we'll see some uses for it soon.

In addition to the hidden directories `..` and `.`, you also see a directory called `.secret/`. This is a hidden directory. Sometimes you may encounter hidden files (like `.bash_profile`) or hidden directories (like the above) which are demarcated with a '.`. These are usually files and directories that are used to configure different programs on your computer. The prefix `.` is used to prevent these configuration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard `ls` command is used.

***

These then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:
`pwd`, `ls` and `cd`.  Let's explore some variations on those commands.  What happens
if you type `cd` on its own, without giving a directory?  

~~~
$ cd
~~~

How can you check what happened?  `pwd` gives us the answer! 

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
~~~
/Users/kshank
~~~

It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home directory,
which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.  

Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before.  Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `data` in one step:

~~~
$ cd Users/kshank/Desktop/data
~~~

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`.

##Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing just this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre` in her home directory
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

Nelle names her directories "year-month-day",
with leading zeroes for months and days,
because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
If she used month names,
December would come before July;
if she didn't use leading zeroes,
November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first
means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as "NENE01729A".
This is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

Now in her current directory,
Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
~~~

This is a lot to type,
but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called **tab completion**.
If she types:

~~~
$ ls nor
~~~

and then presses tab (the tab key on her keyboard),
the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
~~~

If she presses tab again,
Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command,
since it's the only possible completion.
Pressing tab again does nothing,
since there are 19 possibilities;
pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,
and so on.
This is called **tab completion**,
and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.

## CHALLENGE QUESTIONS

Starting from `/Users/amanda/data/`, which of the following commands could Amanda use to navigate to her home directory, which is `/Users/amanda`?

  1. `cd .`
  2. `cd /`
  3. `cd /home/amanda`
  4. `cd ../..`
  5. `cd ~`
  6. `cd home`
  7. `cd ~/data/..`
  8. `cd`
  9. `cd ..`

## CHALLENGE ANSWERS

  1. No: `.` stands for the current directory.
  2. No: `/` stands for the root directory.
  3. No: Amanda's home directory is `/Users/amanda`.
  4. No: this goes up two levels, i.e. ends in `/Users`.
  5. Yes: `~` stands for the user's home directory, in this case `/Users/amanda`.
  6. No: this would navigate into a directory `home` in the current directory if it exists.
  7. Yes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.
  8. Yes: shortcut to go back to the user's home directory.
  9. Yes: goes up one level.
